# Solututions by Andy Russo
These are my submissions for the [Tact smart battle][1].  
These are not nearly my final submissions (except B and E, which didn't
get a lot of special treatment), but rather last reasonable Tact
submissions without Fift and (severe) test abuse.  
My final submissions will be published [here][2] (not published yet).

These aren't exactly the submissions, but the score and gas usage is
identical - I only added comments, formatting, constants.

Here are the scores for these tasks:
| Task number | Task letter | Score  |
| :---------: | :---------: | :----: |
| 1           | A           | 100.44 |
| 2           | B           | 168.44 |
| 3           | C           | 225.92 |
| 4           | D           | 250.69 |
| 5           | E           | 260.63 |

The solutions are heavily commented where it makes sense.
Basic understanding of TL-B and bitwise operations is assumed.
